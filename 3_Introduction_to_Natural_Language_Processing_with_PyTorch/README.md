这里是微软的课程之一，用pytorch进行自然语言处理。由于本地计算资源的问题以及一堆包需要下载，所以这里的很多文件全部放在colab上运行了。



# Introduction to Natural Language Processing with PyTorch

- 55 min

- 7 Units

In this module, we will explore different neural network architectures for dealing with natural language texts. In the recent years, **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) has experienced fast growth primarily due to the performance of the language models’ ability to accurately "understand" human language faster while using unsupervised training on large text corpora. We will learn about different NLP techniques such as using bag-of-words (BoW), word embeddings and recurrent neural networks for classifying text from news headlines to one of the 4 categories (World, Sports, Business and Sci-Tech).

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Understand how text is processed for natural language processing tasks
- Get introduced to using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Generative Neural Networks (GNNs)
