        "\n",
        "In our previous example, the model embedding layer learnt to map words to vector representation, however, this representation did not have much semantical meaning. It would be nice to learn such vector representation, that similar words or symonims would correspond to vectors that are close to each other in terms of some vector distance (eg. euclidian distance).\n",
        "\n",
        "To do that, we need to pre-train our embedding model on a large collection of text in a specific way. One of the first ways to train semantic embeddings is called **Word2Vec**.   It helps **_map the probability of a word_**, based on the contexts from texts in the sequence.  It is based on two main architectures that are used to produce a distributed representation of words:\n",
        "\n",
        " - **Continuous bag-of-words** (CBoW) — in this architecture, we train the model to predict a word from surrounding context. Given the ngram $(W_{-2},W_{-1},W_0,W_1,W_2)$, the goal of the model is to predict $W_0$ from $(W_{-2},W_{-1},W_1,W_2)$.  For example:  **_\"I like my hot dog on a __\"_**.  Here the predicted word would be **_\"bun\"_**.\n",
        " - **Continuous skip-gram** is opposite to CBoW. The model uses surrounding window of context words to predict the current word.  For example: you can predict **_dog_** to be more associated with the word **_veterinary_**.\n",
        "\n",
        "CBoW is faster, while skip-gram is slower, but does a better job of representing infrequent words.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img alt=\"Image showing both CBoW and Skip-Gram algorithms to convert words to vectors.\" src=\"images/4-embedding-5.png\" align=\"middle\" />\n",
        "\n",
        "Both CBOW and Skip-Grams are “predictive” embeddings, in that they only take local contexts into account. Word2Vec does not take advantage of global context.   \n",
        "\n",
        "- **GloVe** (Global Vectors) - derives the relationship between words. It determines how often a particular word-pair occurs together in a text by leveraging the idea of co-occurence matrix and uses neural methods to decompose co-occurrence matrix into more expressive and non linear word vectors.\n",
        "- **FastText** - builds on Word2Vec by learning vector representations for each word and the charachter n-grams found within each word. The values of the representations are then averaged into one vector at each training step. While this adds a lot of additional computation to pre-training, it enables word embeddings to encode sub-word information.\n",
        "- **Gensim** (Generate Similar) - is an open source NLP Python library that provides a unified interface to build word vectors, corpus, perform topic identification, and other NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "FastText and GloVe are other word embeddings techniques that predict the probably of words appearing together.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In our Word2Vec examples, we'll using pre-trained semantic embeddings, but it is interesting to see how those embeddings can be trained using either FastText, CBoW, or Skip-gram architectures. This exercise goes beyond this module, but those interested can reference Word Embeddings tutorials on Pytorch's website. "

This can cause problems in downstream models, since many words such as the word 'play' have different meanings depending on the context they are used in.\n",
